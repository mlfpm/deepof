## Style Guide

We use the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter for this project. Please ensure your contributions adhere to this standard before submitting a pull request. You can check and format your code using Black:

 ```
 black your_file.py
 ```

Black will automatically format your code to meet the style guide.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints and is formatted with Black.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and requests. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
